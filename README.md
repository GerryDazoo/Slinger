# Slinger

Slinger is a project that allows SlingPlayer, Slingboxes and MediaPlayers to stream content:

- On the same LAN
- Connecting from the Internet
- Fully distributed (Cloud-based) 

> Sticking it to the Man, one slingbox at a time


## Version log

- Ver. 3.08: This now supports the 240/350/500/M1/M2/Solo/Pro and ProHD

## Documentation

It is highly recommended to review the following documents located in this repo as they provide more information to help you with you own setup:

- [SlingboxServerNetworkingGuide.pdf](SlingboxServerNetworkingGuide.pdf)
- [V3.0x_ReleaseNotes.pdf](V3.0x_ReleaseNotes.pdf)
- [V3.08_release_notes.pdf](V3.08_release_notes.pdf)
- [V3.08d_release_notes.pdf](V3.08d_release_notes.pdf)
- [V3.08e_release_notes.docx](V3.08e_release_notes.docx)


## Setup instructions

You can select what type of slingbox you have with the `sbtype = entry` in the `config.ini` file.
 
 You'll need your SlingBox **admin password**. You can obtain this by logging into Slingbox's site at
 
 - [http://newwatch.slingbox.com/](http://newwatch.slingbox.com/)
 
 And then browsing:
 
 - [https://newwatchsecure.slingbox.com/watch/slingAccounts/account_boxes_js](https://newwatchsecure.slingbox.com/watch/slingAccounts/account_boxes_js)

 
 That address is a JSON document that contains entries of: `adminPassword`.

 *Sample* output:
 
 ```json
var sling_account_boxes= {
    "memberslingbox":{
        "0ffffe4a2950f319d6e6bd7dcb4e4ebc" : {
            "lookupByFinderId":true,
            "adminPassword":"09s6HW1Nwk8iRYB",
            "userPassword":"11fwWpl3drrfcRgf9",
            "finderId":"0FFFFE4A2950F319D6E6BD7DCB4E4EBCC",
            "isOwner":true,
            "productSignature":16,
            "passwordAutoMode":true,
            "displayName":"My Slingbox",
            "memberSlingBoxId":2146240
        }
    }
    ,"size":1
}
```

#### **Bonus**

- The HTTP streaming server can server out mutliple simultaneous streams so more than one person can see the Sling content at once.

- The web-based remote control is yet another huge hack to get something working quickly. Uses "Flask", definately can be made prettier. You can tweek the look in the [REMOTE] section of the config.ini file. You can insert any valid HTML between the buttons and change the button and text style.

## To watch your slingbox

Use a media player that supports http streaming. I've tested
- VLC
- OBS studio
- Ffplayer
- Mxplayer

Just configure:
```h
http://your_ip_address_or_FQDN:your_port_number/slingbox
```

Your_port_number defaults to `8080` but you can override that with the `port = entry` in the `SERVER` section of `config.ini` file. I.e.:

```
http://192.168.1.10:8080/slingbox
```

## Important

THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE PEOPLE MAKE SETTING THIS UP. THE IP ADDRESS IS FOR THE HOST RUNNING THE SERVER CODE NOT THE SLINGBOX. DO NOT USE THE SLINGBOX IP ADDRESS, IT WILL NOT WORK.

YOU CONNECT TO THE SERVER TO STREAM VIDEO NOT THE SLINGBOX. 
IT'S THE SERVER THAT TALKS TO THE SLINGBOX AND FORWARDS THE VIDEO TO YOU.
THE URL IS CASE SENSITIVE.

DO NOT USE '`Slingbox`' OR ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT '`slingbox`'. "`slingbox`" is the default. It is now possible to change this.

Read the **Release notes pdf** document located in this repo.

THE [`SERVER`] port number is configured in the `config.ini` file. IT DEFAULTS TO `8080`.

Some people feel compelled to change this to the same port number as the slingbox and I don't know why. It only seems to add confusion to what is happening.   

## Remote control

To access the Remote control functionality, use the same IP address and port number but replace "`slingbox`" with Remote into any ol' web browser.i.e.

```
http://192.168.1.10:8080/Remote
```

## Linux/RaspberryPi Notes

You'll need a working **Python3** interpreter to get going. Comes pre-installed on the Raspberry Pi distribution:

* A minimum system is just less that 2G. So for safety sake use at least a 4G micro sd card
Make a user "slingbox" with whatever password you'd like

```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

* You don't need the flask module if you're not using the embedded web server to server out the Remote Control page. Disable the remote in your config.ini file set enableremote=no.

```sh
    sudo pip install flask
```

* You don't need netifaces if you configure the slingbox ip address and port number in the config.ini file

```sh
    sudo pip install netifaces
```    
* Copy "slingbox_server.py, config.ini and sling.service to /home/slingbox   

```sh
    sudo cp sling.service /etc/systemd/system/.
    # enable it
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable sling.service
    sudo systemctl start sling.service
    
    sudo systemctl stop sling.service # to shut it down   
```

* The default config generates a log file /tmp/sling.log   to check to see what's going on....

As root, add or modify the two following lines to your /etc/sysctl.conf 

```py
    net.core.rmem_max = 8192000
    net.core.wmem_max = 8192000
```


### Adding your own remote

To add your own remote, please do following:

1. Create a new branch and follow this naming convention:
    
    > add-remote-`<your-remote-name>`

2. Add your control in the folder named `CustomRemotes`, name your file:

    > `Model`Remote.txt

The branch will be reviewed and approved for merging if passed.


## Notes for Windows users

There is a `windows executable` now available so you don't need to do a python install but your welcome to run the python code directly if you want.

I used `cygwin` Python on my Windows box but any windows python program should work.

You'll need flask and netifaces module for python. See note about netifaces and flask above.

1. Make a folder "slingbox" somewhere
1. Copy `slinbox_server.py`, `config.ini` and `RunSling.bat` to the slingbox folder

If you want to have the server start automatically on boot make a shortcut to `RunSling.bat` in the Startup folder.

  1. You need to open the port your using in your firewall on the server box if it's enabled.
  1. The port number the server binds to is set in the config.ini file, defaults to 8080. 
1. If you want remote access add a port map on your firewall to redirect to your server box.

### Security

Windows Defender may think there are two viruses in the slingbox_server.exe file. This is not the case. Add an exception on your system for slingbox_server.exe

    PC Settings/Update & Security/Windows Security/Virus & Threat Protection/Virus & Thread protection Settings/Add or Remove Exclusions/Add an exclusion:
    
    Enter the path to slingbox_server.exe

    Apparently there is a way around this by changing the source code and then signing the executable but I haven't tested it yet.
     
### Not getting what your expecting?

Note the Slingbox does not upscale the input, See [https://www.slingbox.com/help/KB/KB-2000464](https://www.slingbox.com/help/KB/KB-2000464)
 for more info.
